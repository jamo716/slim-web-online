Description: Simulates a population that mates assortatively for some phenotypic trait. 
            The phenotypic trait is determined by k diploid QTL loci with allelic effects
            of either +1 or -1. Simulation runs for 200 generations. 

Outputs: Phenotypic values of 50 randomly sampled individuals every 10 generations to be used in histograms. 

Inputs: 
    Population size:
                Low (500), medium (750), high (1000)
    Strength of assortative mating:
                Low (0.05), medium (0.25), high (0.5)
    Number of QTL (k):
                Low (5), medium (10), high (15)
